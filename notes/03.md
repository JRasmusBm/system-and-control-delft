We will be given a formula sheet of things we are not expected to know by
heart.

## Generalized Elements

![../img/table.png]{}

I: f = fhat(p) or p = phat(f) => Masses, inductors etc.
C: e = fhat(q) or q = qhat(e) => Springs, capacitors etc.
R: e = ehat(f) or f = fhat(e) => Dampers, resistors etc.
S: e = ehat(f) or f = fhat(e) => Supplied forces, sources etc.
TF and GY: e_1 = e_1hat(f_1) or f_2 = f_2hat(e_2) => Transformers, gyrators etc.

## Generalized dynamical relationship

f(t) = dq(t)/dt
e(t) = dp(t)/dt

Generalized interconnective relationships are called junctions.

M stands for generalized memristor, p = phat(q) or q=qhat(p)

# Bond graphs

## Creating Bond Graphs

### Electrical Domain

- 0-junction at every well-defined potential
- 1-junction at every I, C, R or S element
- use grounded points that have zero voltage to remove bonds
- use simplification rules

### Mechanical Domain

- 1-junction at every "fixed speed"
- 0-junction to make speed difference, and additionally 1-junction to use the
  speed difference as a "fixed" speed
- introduce the elements
- use simplification rules
- use zero velocity points to remove bonds
